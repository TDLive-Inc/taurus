# TDLive.org Project Taurus
Social networking that depends on data from *other* sites.

## Love and hugs <3

Join #taurus-dev on irc.tdlive.org for help with installing, developing, and setting up Taurus. Keep in mind that we _do_ idle. In fact TDLive is connected to IRC all day erryday.

## Installing Taurus

TODO

## Setting up Taurus

All of Taurus' configuration settings are in settings.php. Documentation for settings.php is coming soon...

## Development status (as of 4/23/13)

We are still **very** unstable. Do not run Taurus in a production environment. Use at your own risk if you do.
